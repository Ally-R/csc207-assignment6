## Sources
* For concat string method: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
* Talked briefly with Charun about our general ideas around determining the complexity of a given method, and translating this to Big-O notation.
* Several short discussions with Sam Rebelsky about Big-O and fastModExpt recursion
